Dotfiles

--------------------
I think I succesfully rebooted vim. I want to focus on having a more simple vimrc, and I think using vim-plug will help with managing packages. Now I need to slowly go through my old vimrc and figure out what I need/am missing.

--------------------
I believe my oh-my-zsh reboot is going well. I will now attempt the vim config. Note, I have left `TODO`
markers throughout of things that would be nice to add.

--------------------

I want to start over again with my development tools.

I need to take notes about things I need to recover. 

- Important aliases (Done, added to bottom of `.zshrc`)
- the autojump j command (Done, its a oh-my-zsh packagge)
- python path, and conda stuff (Done, added two lines from previous config)

A repository to store my configurations and dotfiles
