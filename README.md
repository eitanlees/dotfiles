Dotfiles

--------------------
I believe my zsh reboot is going well. I will now attempt the vim config. Note, I have left `TODO`
markers throughout of things that would be nice to add.

--------------------

I want to start over again with my development tools.

I need to take notes about things I need to recover. 

- Important aliases (added to bottom of )
- the autojump j command (Done, oh-my-zsh packagge)
- python path, and conda stuff (Done, added two lines from previous config)
- latexmk and other latex commands
