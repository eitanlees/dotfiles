# Notes

I want a place where I can log my thoughts and experiences with this new 
wave of configuration excitement. 

## Captains Log

2023-04-05 Date Mania. See that date there. I want to have a keybinding 
which can insert the date in the at format. I had something similar in 
vim a while back but I want to set it up again now. I am finding it 
difficult to convert random vim scripts into the proper lua form. 

I guess that is how I learn. Learn by doing. 

OK here we go ... aaaannnnndddd it didn't work out this time. 

I tried to create a remap, but couldn't figure out the lua. I tried
to install a snippet library but couldn't figure out the completion. 

What a mess. It will have to wait another day.
